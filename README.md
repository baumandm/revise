# Revise

Clojure RethinkDB client. Asynchronous, lock-free, efficient, and easy to use!

Query RethinkDB using semantics familiar to any Clojure programmer.

## Stability

Alpha-grade at this point, we're seeking people who want to use Clojure and RethinkDB to help us harden it up.

We're confident this is already one of the more feature-complete community-maintained libraries.

## Leiningen

!["Leiningen version"](https://clojars.org/revise/latest-version.svg)

## Connection Management

[A brief explanation is here](connections.md)

## Introduction

These docs are - for now - loosely based on the python api docs. The driver
works on version `1.9` and `1.10` (in our testing so far) of RethinkDB.

## Usage

```clojure
(require '[bitemyapp.revise.connection :refer [connect close]])
(require '[bitemyapp.revise.query :as r])
(require '[bitemyapp.revise.core :refer [run run-async]])

;; connect returns the connection agent
(let [local-conn  (connect) ;; defaults to localhost
      ;; pass in connection options map to specify beyond the defaults
      remote-conn (connect {:host "99.99.99.1"
                            :port 28015
                            :auth-key ""})
      ;; Run a query and return the result. Blocks as long as it needs to
      ;; get a result (or an error)
      response1 (-> (r/db "test") (r/table-create-db "authors") (run local-conn))
      ;; We may be having issues so we specify a timeout to run
      response2 (-> (r/db "test") (r/table-list-db) (run remote-conn 15000))
      ;; We want to run a query asynchronously - giving up the error handling
      response3 (-> (r/db-list) (run-async local-conn))]
  ;; dereference the promise to block on it.
  (println @response3)
  ;; We are done using the local connection
  (close local-conn))
```

## Connecting to RethinkDB

Inside the namespace `bitemyapp.revise.connection` there are 2 functions we need:

* `connect` `([& [conn-map]])`
* `close` `([conn])`

`connect` takes an optional connection map to override any or all of the default
values:

* `:host` `"127.0.0.1"`
* `:port` `28015`
* `:token` `0` The token of the first query to the connection. Autoincrements.
* `:auth-key` `""` The authentication key.

Connect will return an agent to which you can send queries.

To close the connection use the function `close` with the agent as argument.

## Sending queries

Inside the namespace `bitemyapp.revise.core` there are again 2 functions we need:

* `run` `([query connection & [timeout]])`
* `run-async` `([query connection])`

Our queries are compiled and sent to the connection using those two functions.

`run` takes an optional timeout in milliseconds (default `10000`) and will block
until it has a response or it times out. It will throw when it times out or the
agent dies due to an exception when sending a query.

`run` will return a map which includes the autoincrementing `token` that was
implicitly sent to the agent and either a `:response` in case the query was
successful or an `:error`, `:response` and `:backtrace` in case there was
an error with our request (in this case the driver doesn't throw an exception).

Alternatively we might decide to use `run-async` to send and run queries
asynchronously. This will return us a promise which we can dereference.

Note that `run-async` gives up the error handling of `run`. The agent _might_
die and you will have to check for it manually.

After dereferencing the promise the return value will be the same as `run`.

## Compiling a query manually

`run` and `run-async` have an implicit call to `bitemyapp.revise.protoengine/compile-term`.
This compiles the query into protocol buffers. If you know about the official
RethinkDB API and you want to inspect the protocol buffers Revise gives you, you
can compile a query using that function. To send manually compiled queries to the
database, use `send-term` in the `bitemyapp.revise.connection` namespace.
That will be the equivalent of using `run-async`.

## API

The api is under the namespace bitemyapp.revise.query.

```clojure
(require '[bitemyapp.revise.query :as r])
```

Note: rethinkdb doesn't let you use hyphens (`-`) as part of database or table
names. Revise won't 'fix' those names for you.

Also note that keywords and strings are interchangeable.

### Lambdas

Many queries such as `map`, `filter`, etc. support lambdas. Lambdas are anonymous
functions with syntax like clojure's `fn`.

Example:

```clojure
(-> [1 2 3 4 5 6 7]
    (r/map (r/lambda [n]
             (r/* n 2)))
    (run conn))
```

This will give you the response `([2 4 6 8 10 12 14])`

### Manipulating databases

#### db-create
`([db-name])`

Create a database.

```clojure
(-> (r/db-create "my_db") (run conn))
```

#### db-drop
`([db-name])`

Drop a database.

```clojure
(-> (r/db-drop "my_db") (run conn))
```

#### db-list
`([])`

List the database names in the system.

```clojure
(-> (r/db-list) (run conn))
```

### Manipulating tables

#### table-create-db

`([db table-name & {:as optargs}])`

Create a table on the specified database. The following options are available:

* `:primary-key` The name of the primary key. Default: `:id`.
* `:durability` If set to `:soft`, this enables soft durability on this table:
writes will be acknowledged by the server immediately and flushed to disk in the
background. Default is `:hard` (acknowledgement of writes happens after data has been
written to disk).
* `:cache-size` Set the cache size (in bytes) to be used by the table.
The default is 1073741824 (1024MB).
* `:datacenter` The name of the datacenter this table should be assigned to.

```clojure
(-> (r/db "test") (r/table-create-db "authors") (run conn))
(-> (r/db "test") (r/table-create-db "users" :primary-key :email) (run conn))
```

#### table-create

`([table-name & {:as optargs}])`

Like `table-create-db` except that the db is the default db.

```clojure
(-> (r/table-create "authors") (run conn))
```

#### table-drop-db

`([db table-name])`

Drop a table from a specific db. The table and all its data will be deleted.

```clojure
(-> (r/db "test") (r/table-drop-db "authors") (run conn))
```

#### table-drop

`([table-name])`

Like `table-drop-db` except the default db is used.

```clojure
(-> (r/table-drop "authors") (run conn))
```

#### index-create

`([table index-name lambda1 & [multi?]])`

Create a new secondary index with a given name on the specified table.

```clojure
(-> (r/table "authors")
    (r/index-create :author
                    (r/lambda [author]
                      (r/get-field author :name)))
    (run conn))
;; Compound index
(-> (r/table "authors")
    (r/index-create :name-tv-show
                    (r/lambda [author]
                      [(r/get-field author :name)
                       (r/get-field author :tv-show)]))
    (run conn))
;; A multi index. The r/lambda of a multi index should return an array. It will allow
;; you to query based on whether a value is present in the returned array
(-> (r/table "authors")
    (r/index-create :posts
                    (r/lambda [author]
                      (r/get-field author :posts)) ; returns an array
      true) ; :multi -> true
    (run conn))
```

#### index-drop

`([table index-name])`

Delete a previously created secondary index of this table.

```clojure
(-> (r/table "authors") (r/index-drop :posts) (run conn))
```

#### index-list

`([table])`

List all the secondary indexes of this table.

```clojure
(-> (r/table "authors") (r/index-list) (run conn))
```

### Writing data
#### insert

`([table data & {:as optargs}])`

Insert json documents into a table. Accepts a single json document (a clojure map)
or an array of documents (a clojure vector of clojure maps).

Accepts the following options:

* `:upsert` A `bool`. Default is true. If true it will overwrite documents that
already exist.
* `:durability` `:soft` or `:hard`. Override the durability of the table for this
operation.
* `:return-vals` A `bool`. Only valid for single object inserts. If `true` you
get back the row you inserted on the key `:nev_val`. And if you overwrote a row
it will be in `:old_val`


```clojure
(def authors [{:name "William Adama" :tv-show "Battlestar Galactica"
               :posts [{:title "Decommissioning speech",
                        :rating 3.5
                        :content "The Cylon War is long over..."},
                       {:title "We are at war",
                        :content "Moments ago, this ship received word..."},
                       {:title "The new Earth",
                        :content "The discoveries of the past few days..."}]}

              {:name "Laura Roslin", :tv-show "Battlestar Galactica",
               :posts [{:title "The oath of office",
                        :rating 4
                        :content "I, Laura Roslin, ..."},
                       {:title "They look like us",
                        :content "The Cylons have the ability..."}]}])

(def jean-luc {:name "Jean-Luc Picard", :tv-show "Star Trek TNG",
               :posts [{:title "Civil rights",
                        :content "There are some words I've known since..."}]})

(-> (r/table "authors")
    (r/insert authors)
    (run conn))

(-> (r/table "authors")
    (r/insert jean-luc :return-vals true)
    (run conn))
```

Insert returns a map with the following attributes:

* `:inserted` The number of documents that were succesfully inserted.
* `:replaced` The number of documents that were updated when upsert is used.
* `:unchanged` The number of documents that would have been modified, except that
the new value was the same as the old value when doing an upsert.
* `:errors` The number of errors encountered while inserting; if errors were
encountered while inserting, first_error contains the text of the first error.
* `:generated_keys` A list of generated primary key values deleted and skipped:
0 for an insert operation.

If you specified :return-vals true you will also get the following keys:
* `:nev_val` The value of the object you inserted
* `:old_val` The value of the object you overwrote (`nil` if you didn't)

#### update

`([stream-or-single-selection lambda1-or-obj])`

Update JSON documents in a table. Accepts a JSON document (clojure map), a RQL
expression or a combination of the two. Accepts the following optional keys:

* `:durability` `:soft` or `:hard` - Override the table's durability for this
operation.
* `:return-vals` A `bool`. Only valid for single-row modifications. If `true`
return the new value in `:new_val` and the old value in `:old_val`.
* `non-atomic` A `bool`. Allow the server to run non-atomic operations.

```clojure
;; Make all authors be fictional
(-> (r/table "authors") (r/update {:type "fictional"}))
;; Add the rank of admiral to William Adama
(-> (r/table "authors")
  (r/filter (r/lambda [row]
              (r/= "William Adama"
                (r/get-field row :name))))
  (r/update {:rank "Admiral"})
  (run conn))
;; Add a post to Jean-Luc
(-> (r/table "authors")
    (r/filter (r/lambda [row]
                (r/= "Jean-Luc Picard"
                  (r/get-field row :name))))
    (r/update
      (r/lambda [row]
        {:posts
         (r/append (r/get-field row :posts)
           {:title "Shakespeare"
            :content "What a piece of work is man.."})}))
    (run conn))
```

Update returns a map that contains the following attributes:

* `:replaced` The number of documents that were updated.
* `:unchanged` The number of documents that would have been modified except the new
value was the same as the old value.
* `:skipped` The number of documents that were left unmodified because there was
nothing
to do: either the row didn't exist or the new value is null.
* `:errors` The number of errors encountered while performing the update; if errors
occured, first_error contains the text of the first error.
* `:deleted` and `:inserted` Are 0 for an update operation.

#### replace

`([stream-or-single-selection lambda1-or-obj & {:as optargs}])`

Replace documents in a table. The new document must have the same primary key as the
original document. Accepts the following optional arguments:

* `:non-atomic` Allow non-atomic updates.
* `:durability` `:soft` or `:hard`. Override the table or query's default
durability setting.
* `:return-vals` A `bool` Return the old and new values of the row you're
modifying when set to true (only valid for single row replacements).

```clojure
;; Assuming :name is the primary key on the table
(-> (r/table "authors") (r/get "Wooster")
    (r/replace {:tv-show "Jeeves"} :return-vals true)
    (run conn))
```

#### delete

`([stream-or-single-selection & {:as optargs}])`

Delete the rows in a selection. Accepts the following optional arguments:

* `:durability` Default: `:soft`; Override the table or query's default durability
setting. Other possible values: `:hard`
* `:return-vals` Default: `true`; Return the old value of the row you're deleting
when set to true (only valid for single row deletes) on the key `:old_val`

```clojure
(-> (r/table "authors")
    (r/filter (r/lambda [row]
                (r/< (r/count (r/get-field row :posts))
                     3)))
    (r/delete)
    (run conn))
```

`delete` returns a map with the following attributes:

* `:deleted` The number of documents that were deleted.
* `:skipped` The number of documents from the selection that were left unmodified
because there was nothing to do. For example, if you delete a row that has already
been deleted, that row will be skipped.
* `:errors` The number of errors encountered while deleting if errors occured,
first_error contains the text of the first error.
* `:inserted` Replaced, and unchanged: all 0 for a delete operation.

If you deleted only one row and `return-vals` is `true` then you also get the
following keys:

* `:new_val` Is nil.
* `:old_val` Contains the value of the document you deleted

### Selecting data

#### db

`([db-name])`

Reference a database. This will give you an error if you try to run it. If you want
a list of tables use `r/table-list-db`

```clojure
(r/db "test")
(r/db :test)
```

#### table-db

`([db table-name])`

Select all documents on a table. This command can be chained with other commands to
do further processing on the data

```clojure
(-> (r/db "test") (r/table-db "authors") (run conn))
```

#### table

`([table-name])`

Like table-db except that it uses the default database.

```clojure
(-> (r/table "authors") (run conn))
```

#### get

`([table key])`

Get a document by its primary key.

```clojure
;; After setting the secondary index :name on the table "authors"
(-> (r/table "authors") (r/get "7644aaf2-9928-4231-aa68-4e65e31bf219")
    (run conn))
```

#### get-all

`([table keys-vec & [index]])`

Get all documents where the given value matches the value of the requested index

```clojure
;; After setting the secondary key :name on the table :authors
(-> (r/table "authors")
    (r/get-all ["William Adama"] :name)
    (run conn))
```

#### between

`([stream-selection lower-key upper-key & [index]])`

Get all documents between two keys. index can be the name of a secondary index.
`[lower-key upper-key)`

```clojure
;; Assuming the primary key on our table is a number.
(-> (r/table "authors") (r/between 10 20) (run conn))
```

#### filter

`([sequence lambda1-or-obj & [default-val]])`

Filter a sequence with either a function or a shortcut object.
The body of `filter` is wrapped in an implicit `(default .. false)`  and you
can change the default value by specifying the `default-val` optarg. If you
make the default `(error)`, all errors caught by default will be rethrown
as if the default did not exist

```clojure
(-> (r/table "authors")
    (r/filter (r/lambda [row]
                (r/= (r/get-field row :name) "William Adama")))
    (run conn))
```

### Joins

#### inner-join

`([sequence1 sequence2 predicate])`

Returns the inner product of two sequences (e.g. a table and a filter result) filtered
by the predicate. The query compares each row of the left sequence with each row of
the right sequence to find all pairs of rows which satisfy the predicate (a `lambda`
of two arguments). When the predicate is satisfied, each matched pair of rows of both
sequences are combined into a result row.

```clojure
(-> (r/table "marvel")
    (r/inner-join (r/table "dc")
      (lambda [marvel-row dc-row]
        (r/< (get-field marvel-row :strength)
             (get-field dc-row :strength))))
    (run conn))
```

#### outer-join

`([sequence1 sequence2 predicate])`

Computes a left outer join by retaining each row in the left table even if no match
was found in the right table.

```clojure
(-> (r/table "marvel")
    (r/outer-join (r/table "dc")
      (r/lambda [marvel-row dc-row]
        (r/< (get-field marvel-row :strength)
             (get-field dc-row :strength))))
    (run conn))
```

#### eq-join

`([sequence1 left-attr sequence2 & [index]])`

An efficient join that looks up elements in the right table by primary key.
`index` defaults to `:id`

```clojure
(-> (r/table "marvel") (r/eq-join "main_dc_collaborator" (r/table "dc"))
    (run conn))
```

#### zip

`([sequence])`

Used to 'zip' up the result of a join by merging the 'right' fields into 'left' fields
of each member of the sequence.

```clojure
(-> (r/table "marvel") (r/eq-join "main_dc_collaborator" (r/table "dc"))
    (r/zip)
    (run conn))
```

### Transformations

#### map

`([sequence lambda1])`

Transform each element of the sequence by applying the given mapping function.

```clojure
(-> (r/table "authors")
    (r/map (r/lambda [author]
             (r/count (r/get-field author :posts))))
    (run conn))
```

#### with-fields

`([sequence & pathspecs])`

Takes a sequence of objects and a variable number of fields. If any objects in the
sequence don't have all of the specified fields, they're dropped from the sequence.
The remaining objects have the specified fields plucked out. Identical to has-fields
followed by pluck.

```clojure
;; Get a list of authors and their posts, excluding any authors that lack one.
(-> (r/table "authors") (r/with-fields :name :posts)
    (run conn))
```

#### mapcat

`([sequence lambda1])`

Map a function over a sequence and then concatenate the results together

```clojure
;; Get all of the posts of all authors
(-> (r/table "authors")
    (r/mapcat (r/lambda [author]
                (r/get-field author :posts)))
    (run conn))
```

#### order-by

`([sequence & keys-or-orderings])`

Sort the sequence by document values of the given key(s). Defaults to ascending
ordering. To specify order, wrap the key with `(r/asc ..)` or `(r/desc ..)`

```clojure
(-> (r/table "marvel")
    (r/order-by :enemies_vanquished :damsels_saved)
    (run conn))
```

#### skip

`([sequence n])`

Skip a number of elements from the head of the sequence

```clojure
;; Ignore the first authors sorted alphabetically
(-> (r/table "authors")
    (r/order-by :name)
    (r/skip 2)
    (run conn))
```

#### limit

`([sequence n])`

End the sequence after the given number of elements

```clojure
;; Get 10 posts from all of our authors
(-> (r/table "authors")
    (r/mapcat (r/lambda [author]
                (r/get-field author :posts)))
    (r/limit 10)
    (run conn))
```

#### slice

`([sequence start-index end-index])`

Trim the sequence to within the bounds provided.

```clojure
(-> (r/table "marvel")
    (r/order-by :strength)
    (r/slice 5 10)
    (run conn))
```

#### nth

`([sequence idx])`

Get the nth element of a sequence. Zero indexed.

```clojure
(-> (r/table "authors")
    (r/nth 1)
    (run conn))
```

#### indexes-of

`([sequence item-or-predicate])`

Get the indexes of an element in a sequence. If the argument is a predicate, get the
indexes of all elements matching it.

```clojure
(-> (r/indexes-of ["a" "b" "c"] "c") (run conn))
```

#### empty?

`([sequence])`

Test if a sequence is empty.

```clojure
(-> (r/table "authors")
    (r/empty?)
    (run conn))
```

#### union

`([sequence1 sequence2])`

Concatenate 2 sequences

```clojure
(-> (r/table "marvel")
    (r/union
      (r/table "dc"))
    (run conn))
```

#### sample

`([sequence n])`

Select a number of elements from the sequence with uniform random distribution.

```clojure
(-> (r/table "authors")
    (r/sample 2)
    (run conn))
```

### Aggregation

Compute smaller values from large sequences.

#### reduce

`([sequence lambda2 & [init-val]])`

Produce a single value from a sequence through repeated application of a reduction
function.

```clojure
;; How many posts are there?
(-> (r/table "authors")
    (r/map (r/lambda [author] (r/count (r/get-field :posts))))
    (r/reduce (r/lambda [acc next] (r/+ acc next)) 0)
    (run conn))
```

#### count

`([sequence & [filter]])`

Count the number of elements in the sequence. With a single argument, count the number
of elements equal to it. If the argument is a function, it is equivalent to calling
filter before count.

```clojure
(-> (r/table "authors")
    (r/count)
    (run conn))
```

#### distinct

`([sequence])`

Remove duplicates from the sequence.

```clojure
(-> (r/table "marvel")
    (r/mapcat (r/lambda [hero]
                (r/get-field hero :villain-list)))
    (r/distinct)
    (run conn))
```

#### grouped-map-reduce

`([sequence grouping mapping reduction & [base]])`

Partition the sequence into groups based on the `grouping` function. The elements of
each group are then mapped using the `mapping` function and reduced using the
`reduction` function. Generalized form of group-by.

```clojure
;; Compare heroes against their weight class
(-> (r/table "marvel")
    (r/grouped-map-reduce
      (r/lambda [hero] (r/get-field :weight-class)) ; grouping
      (r/lambda [hero] (r/pluck hero :name :strength)) :mapping
      (r/lambda [acc hero]
        (r/branch (r/< (r/get-field acc :strength) ; if
                       (r/get-field hero :strength))
          hero ; then
          acc ; else
          ))
      {:name "none" :strength 0}) ; base
    (run conn))
```

#### group-by

`([sequence keys-array operation-map])`

Groups a sequence by one or more attributes and then applies a reduction.
The third argument is a special literal giving the kind of operation
to be performed and anay necessary arguments.

At present group-by supports the following operations
* :count - count the size of the group
* {:sum attr} - sum the values of the given attribute accross the group
* {:avg attr} - average the values of the given attribute accross the group"

```clojure
(-> (r/table "marvel")
    (r/group-by [:weight-class] {:avg :strength})
    (run conn))

(-> (r/table "marvel")
    (r/group-by [:age :weight-class] :count)
    (run conn))

(-> (r/table "marvel")
    (r/group-by [:weight-class] {:sum :foes-defeated})
    (run conn))
```

#### contains?

`([sequence item-or-lambda1])`

Returns whether or not a sequence contains the specified value, or if functions are
provided instead, returns whether or not a sequence contains values matching all the
specified functions.

```clojure
(-> (r/table "marvel")
    (r/get "ironman")
    (r/get-field "opponents")
    (r/contains? "superman")
    (run conn))
```

### Document manipulation

#### pluck

`([object-or-sequence & selectors])`

Get a subset of an object by selecting some attributes to preserve,
or map that over a sequence

```clojure
(-> (r/table "marvel")
    (r/get "IronMan")
    (r/pluck :reactor-state :reactor-power)
    (run conn))
```

#### without

`([object-or-sequence & pathspecs])`

The opposite of pluck. Get a subset of an object by selecting some attributes to
discard, or map that over a sequence.

```clojure
(-> (r/table "marvel") (r/get "IronMan") (without :personal-victories-list)
    (run conn))
```

#### merge

`([& objects])`

Merge objects. Right-preferential.

```clojure
(-> (r/table "marvel") (r/get "IronMan")
    (r/merge (-> (r/table "loadouts")
                 (r/get :alien-invasion-kit)))
    (run conn))
```

The query `literal` takes a single argument and it can be used to indicate merge
to replace the other object rather than merge it.

#### append

`([sequence item])`

Append a value to an array

```clojure
(-> (r/table "authors")
    (r/filter (r/lambda [author]
                (r/= "William Adama"
                     (r/get-field author name))))
    (r/update (r/lambda [author]
                {:posts
                 (r/append (r/get-field row :posts)
                           ;; Appending a new post
                           {:title "Earth"
                            :content "Earth is a dream.."}))))
    (run conn))
```

#### prepend

`([array item])`

Prepend a value to an array

                     (r/get-field author name))))
    (r/update (r/lambda [author]
                {:posts
                 (r/prepend (r/get-field row :posts)
                              ;; Prepend a post
                              {:title "Cylons"
                               :content "The cylon war is long over"}))))
    (run conn))
```

#### difference

`([array1 array2])`

    (r/get-field :equipment)
    (r/difference "Boots")
    (run conn))
```

#### set-insert

`([array item])`

Add a value to an array as if the array was a set.

(-> (r/table "marvel")
    (r/get "IronMan")
    (r/get-field "equipment")
    (r/set-intersection ["new-boots" "arc-reactor"])
    (run conn))
```

#### get-field

`([sequence-or-object])`

Get a single field from an object. If called on a sequence, gets that field from
every object in the sequence, skipping objects that lack it.

                         #"^A")))
    (run conn))
```

### Math and logic

The following symbols are also part of the api and they should be properly namespace
qualified:

`r/+` Add numbers or concatenate strings or arrays.

`r/-` Substract numbers.

`r/*` Multiply numbers or make a periodic array.

`r/div` Divide numbers. **Note that it's not r//**

`r/mod` Find the remainder of two numbers.

<!-- `r/and` Logical and.  -->

<!-- `r/or` Logical or. -->

`r/=` Test for equality.

`r/not=` Test for inequality.

`r/>` Greater than.

`r/>=` Greater equal.

`r/<` Lower than.

`r/<=` Lower equal.

`r/not` Logical inverse.

### Dates and times

#### now

`([])`

Return a time object representing the time in UTC. The command now() is computed once
when the server receives the query, so multiple instances of r.now() will always
return the same time inside a query.

```clojure
(-> (r/table "users")
    (r/insert {:name "John"
               :subscription-date (r/now)})
    (run conn))
```

#### time

`([year month day & [timezone]] [year month day hour minute second & [timezone])`

Create a time object for a specific time. Timezone is a string like: `"-06:00"`

```clojure
;; Update the birthdate of the user "John" to November 3rd, 1986 UTC
(-> (r/table "user")
    (r/get "John")
    (r/update {:birthdate (r/time 1986 11 3 "Z")])
    (run conn))
```

#### epoch-time

`([epoch-time])`

Create a time object based on seconds since epoch.

```clojure
;; Update the birthdate of the user "John" to November 3rd, 1986
(-> (r/table "user")
    (r/get "john")
    (r/update {:birthdate (r/epoch-time 531360000)})
    (run conn))
```

#### iso8601

`([iso8601-date])`

Create a time object based on an iso8601 date-time string.

```clojure
(-> (r/table "user")
    (r/get "John")
    (r/update {:birth (r/iso8601 "1986-11-03T08:30:00-07:00")})
    (run conn))
```

#### in-timezone

`([time timezone])`

Return a new time object with a different timezone. Results returned by functions
that take the timezone into account will be different.

```clojure
(-> (r/now)
    (r/in-timezone "-08:00)
    (r/hours)
    (run conn))
```

#### timezone

`([time])`

Return the timezone of the time object

```clojure
(-> (r/table "user")
    (r/filter (r/lambda [user]
                (r/= "-07:00"
                  (-> (r/get-field user :subscription-date)
                      (r/timezone)))))
    (run conn))
```

#### during

`([time start-time end-time])`

Returns whether the time is in the range [start-time end-time)

```clojure
(-> (r/table "posts")
    (r/filter (r/lambda [post]
                (-> (r/get-field :date)
                    (r/during (r/time 2013 12 1) (r/time 2013 12 10)))))
    (run conn))
```

#### date

`([time])`

Return a new time object only based on the day, month and year

```clojure
(-> (r/table "users")
    (r/filter (r/lambda [user]
                (r/= (-> (r/now) (r/date))
                  (r/get-field user :birthday))))
    (run conn))
```

#### time-of-day

`([time])`

Return the number of seconds elapsed since the beginning of the day stored in the
time object.

```clojure
;; Posts submitted before noon
(-> (r/table "posts")
    (r/filter (r/lambda [post]
               (r/> (* 12 60 60) ; Can be left as clojure.core/*
                 (-> (r/get-field post :date)
                     (r/time-of-day)))))
    (run conn))
```

### Access time fields

All of these take a `time` as the only argument.

`r/year` Return the year of a time object.

`r/month` Return the month as a number between 1 and 12.

`r/day` Return the day as a number between 1 and 31.

`r/day-of-week` Return the day of week as a number between 1 and 7 (ISO 8601).

`r/day-of-year` Return the day of the year as a number between 1 and 366 (ISO 8601).

`r/hours` Return the hour as a number between 0 and 23.

`r/minutes` Return the minute in a time object as a number between 0 and 59.

`r/seconds` Return the seconds in a time object as a number between 0 and 59.999 (double precision).

#### ->iso8601

`([time])`

Convert a time object to its ISO 8601 format.

```clojure
(-> (r/now)
    (r/to-iso8601)
    (run conn))
```

#### ->epoch-time

`([time])`

Convert a time to its epoch time.

```clojure
(-> (r/now)
    (r/->epoch-time)
    (run conn))
```

### Control structures

#### branch

`([test then else])`

Like an if. The test can be any value. Truthiness appears to be similar to
clojure's (`false` and `nil` are falsey, everything else is truthy).

```clojure
(-> (r/table "marvel")
    (r/map (r/lambda [hero]
             (r/branch (r/<= 100
                         (r/get-field hero :victories))
                       (r/+ (r/get-field hero :name) " is a superhero") ; then
                       (r/+ (r/get-field hero :name) " is a hero"))))   ; else
    (run conn))
```

#### or

`([& bools])`

Like clojure's short-circuiting `or` except that: It short circuits _inside_
RethinkDB and it is a little inneficient in that if your "booleans" are queries
it will probably run them twice.

The same truthy/falsey rules apply as with `branch`.

```clojure
(-> (r/or false false false true) (run conn))
(-> (r/or false nil false "hello!" nil) (run conn))
```

#### and

`([& bools])`

Like clojure's short-circuiting `and` except that: It short circuits _inside_
RethinkDB and it is a little inneficient in that if your "booleans" are queries
it will probably run them twice.

The same truthy/falsey rules apply as with `branch`.

```clojure
(-> (r/and true true true) (run conn))
(-> (r/and 1 2 3 nil) (run conn))
```


#### any

`([& bools])`

A short circuiting or that returns a boolean

```clojure
(-> (r/any false false true) (run conn))
```

#### all

`([& bools])`

Returns true if all of its arguments are true (short-circuiting).

```clojure
(-> (r/all true true true) (run conn))
```

#### foreach

`([sequence lambda1])`

Calls its function with each entry in the sequence and executes the array of
terms that function returns.

```clojure
(-> (r/table "marvel")
    (r/foreach (r/lambda [hero]
                 (-> (r/table "villains")
                     (r/get (r/get-field hero :villain-defeated)))))
    (r/delete)
    (run conn))
```

#### error

`([& [s]])`

Throw a runtime error. If called with no arguments inside the second argument to
default, re-throw the current error.

```clojure
(-> (r/error "kaput") (run conn))
```

#### default

`([item-to-check item-or-lambda1])`

Evaluates its first argument. If that argument returns NULL or throws an error
related to the absence of an expected value, default will either return its
second argument or execute it if it's a function. If the second argument is a
function it will be passed either the text of the error or NULL as its argument.

```clojure
(-> (r/table "projects")
    (r/map (r/lambda [p]
             (r/+ (r/default (r/get-field p :staff) 0)
                  (r/default (r/get-field p :management) 0))))
    (run conn))
```

#### parse-val

`([item])`

Parse a clojure value to construct a json value. Strings, keywords, numbers,
vectors, maps and booleans are allowed. This is the equivalent of `expr` in
python. **Note that since these queries are functions and not methods, this
function is hardly ever needed since it is already implicit.**

```clojure
(r/parse-val [1 false "hello" :goodbye])
```

#### js

`([js-string])`

Create a javascript expression.

```clojure
(-> (r/js "1 + 1") (run conn))
```

#### coerce-to

`([item type-string])`

Convert a value of one type into another.

You can convert: a selection, sequence, or object into an ARRAY, an array of pairs
into an OBJECT, and any DATUM into a STRING.

```clojure
(-> (r/table "marvel")
    (r/coerce-to :array)
    (run conn))
```

#### type

`([item])`

Get the type of a value.

```clojure
(-> (r/parse-val "hello!")
    (r/type)
    (run conn))
```

#### info

`([any])`

Get information about a rql value

```clojure
(-> (r/table "marvel")
    (r/info)
    (run conn))
```

#### json

`([json-str])`

Parse a JSON string on the server.

```clojure
(-> (r/json "[1,2,3]") (run conn))
```

### Time constants

Time constants are already evaluated and so they don't have to be called as fns.

`r/monday`    => 1

`r/tuesday`   => 2

`r/wednesday` => 3

`r/thursday`  => 4
